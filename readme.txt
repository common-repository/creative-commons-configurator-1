Helps you publish your content under the terms of Creative Commons and other licenses. [DEPRECATED]


== Description ==

*Creative-Commons-Configurator* (or simply *CC-Configurator*) is the only tool a user will ever need in order to license the contents of a WordPress powered web site under the terms of a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) or other license. Configuration of the plugin is possible through its configuration panel. Advanced users can further customize the plugin and extend its functionality through filters. It is actively maintained since 2006 (historical [Creative-Commons-Configurator home](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/14/creative-commons-configurator-wordpress-plugin/ "Official historical Creative-Commons-Configurator Homepage")).

**NOTICE:** THIS PLUGIN HAS BEEN **DEPRECATED**. IT IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED. IT IS NO LONGER TESTED WITH NEW WORDPRESS RELEASES. USING IT IN PRODUCTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

IT IS STRONGLY SUGGESTED TO MIGRATE TO OTHER MORE MODERN AND BETTER MAINTAINED PLUGINS.

IF YOU ARE STARTING A NEW BLOG, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO SEARCH FOR OTHER PLUGINS IN ORDER TO AVOID THE INEVITABLE FUTURE MIGRATION.

REGARDING EXISTING USERS, AT THE TIME OF WRITING, THERE ARE NO MAJOR BUGS. PROVIDED THAT THE WORDPRESS API DOES NOT CHANGE SOON, YOU HAVE THE TIME TO EXPERIMENT WITH OTHER PLUGINS AND PLAN YOUR MIGRATION.

<strong>Important Notice</strong>

<br /><br />

Please note that this plugin generates licensing metadata that is different from the metadata generated by the online tools at CreativeCommons.org.

<br /><br />

Due to lack of free time, there are no plans to work on this plugin in the near future. If it does not work as expected for you, I strongly suggest to look for other plugins in the WordPress Plugin Repository.

<strong>Notice for translators</strong>

<br /><br />

The plugin has officially switched to the WordPress <em>Language Packs</em>. All translators should feel free to move the translations to the [translations project](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/creative-commons-configurator-1) on the WordPress Translations Service. The translations that ship with the plugin will no longer be updated and will gradually be removed as soon as each relevant Language Pack becomes ready for use.
